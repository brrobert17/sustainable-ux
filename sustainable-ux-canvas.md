# Sustainable UX Canvas

## 1. Project Overview

**Campaign Name:** Save Our Oceans

**Primary Persona:** The Ocean (Non-human)

**Secondary Persona:** Alex (Screen Reader User with Visual Impairment)

**Key Challenge:** Creating awareness and action around ocean pollution and conservation while minimizing environmental impact of the digital product itself.

## 2. Environmental Impact Assessment

### Digital Carbon Footprint Analysis

**Testing Tool:** [Digital Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/) / [Ecograder](https://ecograder.com/)

**Results:**
- Score: [Insert score/grade]
- [Insert screenshot]

**Key Metrics:**
- Page Size: [Insert size in KB]
- Total Requests: [Insert number]
- Carbon Emissions: [Insert estimate if available]

### Design Decisions for COâ‚‚ Reduction

| Decision | Environmental Benefit | User Experience Impact |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Dark theme by default | Reduced power consumption on OLED/AMOLED screens (up to 30%) | Lower eye strain, especially in low-light environments |
| System fonts instead of web fonts | Reduced file size and HTTP requests | Consistent rendering across devices |
| SVG icons instead of images | Smaller file size, no additional HTTP requests | Crisp rendering at all sizes |
| Minimal JavaScript | Reduced processing power needed | Faster page load, less battery drain |
| Single CSS file | Fewer HTTP requests | Faster initial load |
| No third-party scripts | Eliminated unnecessary data transfer | Improved privacy, faster loading |

## 3. Visible Impact Strategies

### Visual Design Choices

| Element | Sustainable Approach | Traditional Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Color Scheme | Dark theme with limited palette (6 colors) | Light theme with multiple color variations |
| Typography | System fonts only | Custom web fonts |
| Images | SVG illustrations only | High-resolution photos |
| Animations | Minimal, purpose-driven | Decorative, complex |
| Layout | Simple, focused sections | Complex, multi-column |

### Content Strategy

| Aspect | Sustainable Approach | Traditional Alternative |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Copy Length | Concise, focused messaging | Lengthy, detailed content |
| Information Architecture | Flat hierarchy, minimal depth | Deep nested structure |
| Call to Action | Clear, singular focus | Multiple competing CTAs |

## 4. Invisible Impact Optimizations

### Technical Implementation

| Feature | Sustainable Approach | Traditional Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| HTML Structure | Semantic, minimal nesting | Div-heavy, complex nesting |
| CSS | Efficient selectors, minimal rules | Redundant styles, frameworks |
| JavaScript | Vanilla JS, minimal functionality | Heavy frameworks, libraries |
| Server Requests | Single page, minimal assets | Multiple page loads, many assets |
| User Preferences | Store theme choice in localStorage | Reset preferences on each visit |

### Performance Optimizations

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Dark Mode | Default enabled, toggle available | Reduced screen energy consumption |
| Caching | Cache-Control headers | Reduced repeat downloads |
| Code Minification | [Yes/No] | Reduced file size |
| Asset Compression | [Yes/No] | Reduced transfer size |
| Lazy Loading | [Yes/No] | Prioritized critical content |

## 5. Non-Human Persona Integration

### The Ocean's Voice

**How the persona is represented:**
- First-person narrative from the ocean's perspective
- Direct quotes expressing the ocean's feelings and needs
- Visual elements that represent ocean waves and water
- Dark blue color scheme that naturally represents deep ocean waters

**User stories addressed:**
1. "As the ocean, I need online stores to reduce plastic packaging so that less waste ends up polluting my waters."
   - Implementation: [Describe how this is addressed in the design]

2. "As the ocean, I want e-commerce sites to promote sustainable seafood choices to protect marine life."
   - Implementation: [Describe how this is addressed in the design]

3. "As the ocean, I need digital tools to track and raise awareness about ocean plastic pollution."
   - Implementation: [Describe how this is addressed in the design]

4. "As the ocean, I want travel platforms to highlight eco-friendly tourism options that do not harm marine ecosystems."
   - Implementation: [Describe how this is addressed in the design]

5. "As the ocean, I need sustainable fashion brands to showcase ocean-safe materials to reduce microplastic shedding."
   - Implementation: [Describe how this is addressed in the design]

## 6. Social Sustainability

### Accessibility Considerations

| Feature | Implementation | Benefit |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Semantic HTML | Proper heading structure, landmark regions | Screen reader compatibility |
| Color Contrast | WCAG AA compliant in both light and dark themes | Readability for low vision users |
| Keyboard Navigation | All interactive elements accessible | Non-mouse users can navigate |
| Form Accessibility | Proper labels, error handling | All users can complete forms |
| Responsive Design | Mobile-first approach | Works on all devices and screen sizes |
| Theme Toggle | Accessible button with clear icon | Allows users to choose preferred contrast |

### Ethical Design Choices

| Aspect | Ethical Approach | Dark Pattern Alternative |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Data Collection | Minimal, transparent | Excessive, hidden |
| Consent | Clear, opt-in | Pre-checked, hidden |
| Messaging | Honest, factual | Manipulative, fear-based |
| User Agency | Clear choices, easy to decline | Forced actions, guilt trips |
| Theme Preference | Saved but can be easily changed | Forced dark mode without option to change |

## 7. Deceptive Patterns Analysis (Dark UX Version)

### Implemented Dark Patterns

| Pattern Category | Implementation | Ethical Issue |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Artificial Urgency | Countdown timer, "limited spots" | Creates false scarcity |
| Manipulated Choices | Pre-selected options, default opt-ins | Removes user agency |
| Hidden Information | Small print, hidden costs | Lacks transparency |
| Obstruction | Exit-intent popup, guilt-trip decline options | Manipulates emotions |

### Comparison with Sustainable Version

| Element | Sustainable Approach | Dark Pattern Approach |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Form Design | Minimal fields, clear purpose | Extra fields, hidden subscriptions |
| Call to Action | Clear, honest | Urgent, fear-based |
| Information | Transparent, factual | Exaggerated, manipulative |
| User Flow | Easy entry/exit | Difficult to leave |
| Dark Mode | For energy efficiency | For creating urgency and fear |
